Hi! I am a fifth-year graduate student at [Shanghai Center for Mathematical Sciences](https://scms.fudan.edu.cn), Fudan University. My advisor is [Professor Jun Li](https://scms.fudan.edu.cn/info/2661/2694.htm).

My research interests lie in algebraic geometry and related fields, with a focus on moduli spaces of sheaves and enumerative geometry.
